# Liver Cancer Prediction using Random Forest

##  Project Description
This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict
liver cancer using a Random Forest classifier. The workflow includes data
preprocessing, feature scaling, categorical encoding, model training, and
performance evaluation.

##  Problem Statement
Early detection of liver cancer can significantly improve patient outcomes.
This project aims to build a machine learning model that classifies whether
a patient is likely to have liver cancer based on clinical and demographic
features.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Methodology
1. Dataset loading and initial analysis
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning
3. Feature scaling and encoding
4. Train-test split
5. Random Forest model training
6. Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Model Used
- RandomForestClassifier

##  Results
The Random Forest model achieved good classification performance on the
test dataset and demonstrated the effectiveness of preprocessing and
ensemble learning techniques.
